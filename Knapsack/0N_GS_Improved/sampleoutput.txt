0-N Knapsack (improve graph search):

Program runs properly.

Here is an example output:


Item2 : Weight = 2.0 Value = 8.0
Item0 : Weight = 7.0 Value = 15.0
Item1 : Weight = 6.0 Value = 12.0
Weight capacity: 7.0
200:  Weight = 4.0 Value = 16.0
Number of each item (same order as above): [ 2 0 0 ]
Barometer: 8
